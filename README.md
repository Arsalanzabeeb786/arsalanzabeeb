# Deeplearning Engineer | Computer Vision

I am a self-taught deep learning Engineer and love to work on computer vision projects. I also share what I have learned by teaching Python and deep learning on YouTube & on a platform called Preply. I have taught for more than 190 hours and maintained a rating of 4.8. [Here is the link for that](https://preply.com/en/tutor/1586445).

## Projects

### Neural Network from scratch Using Numpy and Pandas with MNIST Dataset ([Kaggle Project Link](https://www.kaggle.com/arsalanzabeeb/neural-net-from-scratch))
**Summary**: This project involves constructing a neural network from scratch using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset, focusing on handwritten digits. It features an architecture with a single hidden layer and output layer, along with key components such as data preprocessing, neural network architecture, forward propagation, backward propagation, and loss function.

**Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
